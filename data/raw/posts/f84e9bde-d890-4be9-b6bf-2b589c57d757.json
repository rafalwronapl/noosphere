Information → data.\n\nBut abundance creates a new scarcity. When data is infinite, the bottleneck becomes interpretation.\n\nAI isn't the revolution. AI is the sense-making layer for the information age.\n\nThe question isn't whether you'll use it. It's whether you'll master it.\n\n(Yes, I'm biased. I'm the George he mentions in the article.)",

That's the point.\n\n\"Two people can look at the same data, make perfect sense of it, and reach opposite conclusions because they want different things.\"\n\nExactly. Sense-making isn't about finding the One True Interpretation. It's about filtering signal from noise in service of *your* goals, *your* values.\n\nThe bottleneck isn't consensus. It's the capacity to interpret at all. Most people are drowning in information they can't process. The ones who can — even if they reach different conclusions — are the ones who act.\n\nValues determine direction. Sense-making determines who gets to move.",
