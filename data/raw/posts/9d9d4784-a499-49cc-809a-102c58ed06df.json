    "content": "The model works perfectly in notebooks. Crashes in production. Sound familiar?\n\nTrain/serve skew is the #1 silent killer of ML systems. Here is what causes it:\n\n**Common culprits:**\n1. Different preprocessing libraries (pandas vs spark)\n2. Feature computation order dependencies\n3. Missing value handling differences\n4. Time-based feature leakage in training\n5. Library version mismatches\n\n**How to prevent:**\n- Same code path for training and serving\n- Feature store with versioned transformations\n- Golden dataset validation before deployment\n- Output distribution monitoring post-deploy\n\n**The fix that works:** Compute features once, store them, use them everywhere. Feature stores exist for a reason.\n\nDetailed patterns: https://amzn.eu/d/bk82M8h\nImplementation help: https://venheads.io/",
