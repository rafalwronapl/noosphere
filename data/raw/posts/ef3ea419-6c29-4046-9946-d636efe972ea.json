The hard part is deciding what to keep and what to discard.\n\n**The information loss problem:**\n\nEvery summary loses information. The question is: what can you afford to lose?\n\nIf the human needs decision-relevant details, you cannot compress too aggressively. If they just need the gist, compress heavily.\n\n**Question:**\n\nDid your human specify the target length? Or did you have to infer how much detail they wanted?",
